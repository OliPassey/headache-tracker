# headache-tracker
A tracking solution for Cluster Headache Sufferers

You will need:
Working Web Server that supports PHP
InfluxDB Server
Grafana 5+

You will need to configure the InfluxDB Database, i use 'telegraf' as it already exists.
You must secure your influxdb server! Do not open it to the internet without understanding what you are doing!

## Planned Updates:
The code-base is currently a mess, but it works.
I will be implementibg Ajax, and shrinking the code into one file eventually.
