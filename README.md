- Lifestyle factors (sleep changes, stress, exercise)
- Physical triggers (neck tension, eye strain)

### **Comprehensive Symptoms**
- Pain characteristics (throbbing, stabbing, burning)
- Neurological symptoms (aura, confusion, coordination issues)
- Autonomic symptoms (nausea, light/sound sensitivity)
- Eye-related symptoms (tearing, redness, droopy eyelid)
- Associated symptoms (mood changes, fatigue)

### **Medications & Relief**
- Acute/rescue medications (triptans, NSAIDs, etc.)
- Preventive medications
- Alternative relief methods
- Effectiveness tracking
